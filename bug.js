This bug occurs when using the Expo `Image` component with a URI that's not accessible or has network issues.  The component might not display the image or throw an error, but it doesn't always provide clear error messages, leading to debugging difficulties.

Example:
```javascript
<Image source={{ uri: 'https://example.com/image.jpg' }} style={{ width: 200, height: 200 }} />
```
If `https://example.com/image.jpg` is unreachable or broken, the image won't load.  The console might not show much more than a network request failure.
